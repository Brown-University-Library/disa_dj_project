# Glossary

(terms sometimes used interchangeably in code, with clarifications — the first listed option is the one currently used by the project)

- **source** / document / citation

    - There is no database 'document' object. Rather, a document is, conceptually, a `Citation` and associated `Reference` entries.

- **record** / item / reference

    - These are the same, the database contains `Reference` entries, each of which provide a linkage between a `Citation` entry and `Referent` entries. A `Reference` entry also contain transcription and other information.

- **referent** / person / entrant

    - An entrant and a referent are the same. The database contains `Referent` entries; a `Referent` is an individual mentioned in a `Reference`.
    - A `Referent` provides a linkage between a `Person` and a `Reference`.
    - The interface currently allows for relationships to be defined between `Referent` entries.

# Installation

(Assumes [Docker](https://www.docker.com) is installed and running.)

- Create a local "stuff" directory (name it anything) -- and from your terminal, cd into it (one-time step)


From the terminal, run:

- `git clone git@github.com:Brown-University-Library/stolen_relations_start_data.git`<br />_(a one-time step; downloading the SR data) Note that this is a private repo, for now; the data is not yet publicly available_
- `git clone git@github.com:Brown-University-Library/disa_dj_project.git`<br/>_(a one-time step, downloads the SR codebase)_
- `cd disa_dj_project`<br />_Sets the current directory to disa\_dj\_project_
- `docker-compose up`<br />_Creates the container (which starts the webapp)_

The webapp should be running; from a browser, go to `http://127.0.0.1:8000/version/` or `http://127.0.0.1:8000/login/`. 

# Typical usage

- `cd <SOME_PATH>/disa_dj_project`<br />_Sets the current directory to disa\_dj\_project_
- `docker-compose up`<br />_Creates the container (which starts the webapp)_

Note: if a code-update installs a new python-package, either:

- delete the `disa_dj_project-web` image which should force it to be rebuilt (best option), **or...**    
- run `docker-compose up --build` to force the container to be rebuilt. (I don't think this actually creates a new image, so subsequent runs of `docker-compose up` will still use the old image.)

# Notes for those of us who don't know Django

Some critical files:

## [disa_dj_project/config/settings.py](https://github.com/Brown-University-Library/disa_dj_project/blob/main/config/settings.py)

Django settings for disa_project. Mostly "where are things" and security keys, etc.

Generated by 'django-admin startproject' using Django 1.11.

[More information on this file](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.11/topics/settings/)

[Full list of settings and their values](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.11/ref/settings/)

## [disa_dj_project/config/urls.py](https://github.com/Brown-University-Library/disa_dj_project/blob/main/config/urls.py)

Maps URL patterns to views, e.g.:

```
url( r'^editor/documents/(?P<cite_id>.*)/$', views.edit_citation, name='edit_citation_url' )
```

which maps to the function definition in [disa_dj_project/disa_app/views.py](https://github.com/Brown-University-Library/disa_dj_project/blob/main/disa_app/views.py):

```
@shib_login
def edit_citation( request, cite_id=None ):
```

## [disa_dj_project/disa_app/admin.py](https://github.com/Brown-University-Library/disa_dj_project/blob/main/disa_app/admin.py)

Seems to extend administrative functions, and handles the "marked for deletion" system. Contains 3 class definitions:

- MarkedForDeletionAdminForm
- UserProfileAdmin
- MarkedForDeletionAdmin

## [disa_dj_project/disa_app/disa_app_templates](https://github.com/Brown-University-Library/disa_dj_project/tree/main/disa_app/disa_app_templates)

The templates for the public pages. These files are referenced in `disa_app/views.py`.

## [disa_dj_project/disa_app/lib](https://github.com/Brown-University-Library/disa_dj_project/tree/main/disa_app/lib)

A bunch of DISA-specific python code. This seems to be the main code area. 

Includes:

- `generate_browse_data.py`
- a bunch of `view_*_manager.py`

## [disa_dj_project/disa_app/models_sqlalchemy.py](https://github.com/Brown-University-Library/disa_dj_project/tree/main/disa_app/models_sqlalchemy.py)

Model definition for SQL Alchemy

## [disa_dj_project/disa_app/models.py](https://github.com/Brown-University-Library/disa_dj_project/tree/main/disa_app/models.py)

Not sure (ask Birkin)

## [disa_dj_project/disa_app/settings_app.py](https://github.com/Brown-University-Library/disa_dj_project/tree/main/disa_app/settings_app.py)

Some random settings—authentication, DB location, etc. Not sure how this relates to `disa_dj_project/config/settings.py`

## [disa_dj_project/disa_app/views.py](https://github.com/Brown-University-Library/disa_dj_project/tree/main/disa_app/views.py)

A bunch of routines that are called by `disa_dj_project/config/urls.py` and reference `disa_dj_project/disa_app/disa_app_templates`.
